# What is it?
A board game with a set of unique rules.

# Rules
* A piece can only be placed on the 8 spots *surrounding* an existing piece owned by the current player.

* When a piece is set, the other player's pieces on the 8 spots *surrounding* it automatically come into current player's possesion.

* When both players consider it unneccessary to continue, either can end the game and show the result. This means all the empty spots will be fill in with available pieces, and the program counts the number of pieces of each player then show the result.

# Have fun!
